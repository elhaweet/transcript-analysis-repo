# AI Agent Transcript Analysis

Unlocking actionable insights from AI agent conversations using VAPI, Python, LLMs, and Loveable.

## Overview

This project goes beyond building AI agents — it focuses on analyzing their conversations to extract meaningful insights such as engagement scores, sentiment, emotion, and intent classification. The system leverages:

- VAPI for collecting transcript data from deployed agents
- Python and Schrödinger's LLM for natural language analysis
- Loveable for visualizing the insights in a clean, no-code dashboard

## Features

- Extracts and parses agent-user conversations from VAPI
- Applies advanced LLM techniques to analyze and classify the transcript data
- Generates structured metrics such as:
  - Engagement levels
  - Sentiment polarity
  - Emotional tone
  - User intent
- Visualizes results using a Loveable frontend interface
- Modular pipeline for future extensibility (e.g., audio, multi-agent, or multilingual support)
